        <h2 class="heading_style">All About Biscuit</h2>
        <p>Biscuit is a long haired Dachshund-Mix. He is 3 years old and very energetic. He loves to chase small tennis balls and squirrels. His legs may be short
            and stubby, but don't let that fool you. He can probably outrun any show dog any day of the week. He is very skittish of bigger dogs but loves other dogs 
            that are his size. His favorite place to sleep is at the top of my husbands head just above the pillow. </p>

 <h2 class="heading_style">How we got Biscuit:</h2>
         <p>We got Biscuit when he was just a few weeks old. My husbands Aunt found him and his sister at an abandoned house. His sister was quickly adopted so we
            were left with Biscuit. Our older Shih Tzu (Sugar) really took a liking to him. She was 10 years old at the time and never liked other animals. So when she 
            started playing with him we knew we had to keep him. The two have been inseperable ever since.</p>

    <h3 class="heading_style">How I work with Biscuit</h3>
        <p>As you can see, Biscuit has a lot of hair. To be honest, the pictures do not do it justice. His tail is the equivalent of a teenage girls pony-tail from the 
            80's. His hair is thick and fine. He required grooming every other week at the least. When I realized this, I quickly invested in a HICOZY pet 
            grooming kit/vacuum. This reduces his dander and keeps his hair shiny and clean and at a manageable length. </p>
