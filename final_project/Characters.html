               caught between doing what's right and navigating the complex world of politics and personal desires. Her quick wit, determination, and resilience make her a powerful figure,
               even when facing overwhelming odds. Despite her flaws and mistakes, Rachel's growth throughout her journey showcases her ability to face adversity with heart and 
               strength.</p>

        <h3 id="hthree">Jenks</h3>
        <img class="characters" style="float: inline-start;" src="images/jenks.jpg" alt="jenks">
        <p>Jenks is a witty, sarcastic pixie who serves as Rachel Morgan's loyal partner and friend in "The Hollows" series. Despite his small size, he is a fierce fighter, skilled with both 
               magic and weapons, often providing comic relief while also adding depth to the team dynamic. Jenks has a deep love for his family and a strong sense of loyalty, especially 
               to Rachel, even when things get complicated. His bravery and no-nonsense attitude make him an invaluable ally, and his growth throughout the series reveals a complex 
               and caring character beneath the tough exterior.</p>

<div class="charcol">
       <h3  id="hthree">Ivy</h3>      
       <img class="characters" style="float: inline-start;" src="images/ivy.jpg" alt="ivy">  
       <p>Ivy Tamwood is a skilled vampire and Rachel Morgan's best friend and roommate in The Hollows. Fiercely independent and morally conflicted, Ivy struggles with her vampiric 
              nature, especially her thirst for blood, which often causes tension in her relationships. Her deep loyalty to Rachel is evident, and she acts as both a mentor and protector, 
              despite her internal battles. Ivy's character evolves from a reserved, almost tortured figure into a more self-assured and accepting individual, dealing with complex emotions 
              around love, identity, and her vampire heritage.</p>

        <h3 id="hthree">Algalierept</h3>      
        <img class="characters" style="float: inline-start;" src="images/al.jpg" alt="al">
        <p>Al is a powerful and somewhat unpredictable demon in The Hollows series, often portrayed as an antagonist with his own complex motivations. He runs a business in the 
               supernatural world, sometimes aligning with Rachel and other times opposing her, making him a morally gray character. Though initially self-serving and ruthless, Al's 
               interactions with Rachel reveal layers of vulnerability, showcasing a struggle between his demonic nature and a desire for something more. Over time, Al's relationship with 
               Rachel becomes less adversarial, hinting at a deeper connection and a potential for growth and redemption.</p>

<div class="charcol">
          <h3 id="hthree">Trent</h3>     
          <img class="characters" style="float: inline-start;" src="images/trent.jpg" alt="trent">
          <p>Trent Kalamack is a wealthy and influential businessman with deep ties to the supernatural world in The Hollows series. Initially presented as a villain, his motives are often 
                 shrouded in secrecy, and heâ€™s involved in morally dubious activities, particularly in his dealings with witches and other magical beings. Despite his manipulative and 
                 sometimes ruthless behavior, Trent's character is more layered than it first appears, with moments of vulnerability and hints of redemption. Over time, his complex 
                 relationship with Rachel Morgan evolves, revealing a blend of attraction, rivalry, and a shared desire to fight against greater threats.</p>
