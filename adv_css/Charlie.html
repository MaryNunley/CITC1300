            <h2 class="heading_style">All About Charlie</h2>
            <p>Charlie is a 5 year old large Pit Bull mix. He weighs 68 lbs and is the biggest baby you will ever meet. He enjoys jumping, 
               running, and playing and even more curious than the average cat. Even though he isnâ€™t a pup anymore, Charlie still has enough 
               energy to tire out a toddler and needs room to run on a daily basis. One of the greatest things about Charlie is that he is the 
               most gentlest of giants. He loves young kids and knows how to be a calm and well behaved dog when they are around.</p>

               <h2 class="heading_style">What Happened?</h2>
               <p>I have had Charlie since November 25, 2024. I know this is longer than the typical length of time for a foster animal but 
                he was found with a massive leg injury in early October. He spent 6 weeks cooped up at the animal hospital in Winchester 
                where he got well enough to be sent to a foster home for the rest of his recuperation. He still has a few weeks left before his 
                leg is completely healed but we are already reaching out to people who want to be potential adopters. </p>

            <h3 class="heading_style">How I work with Charlie</h3>
            <img class="second_charlie" src="images/Charlie2.jpg" alt="Happy Charlie">
            <p>Charlie needs medical care on a daily basis until his leg wound is completely closed. He has moved on from daily hydrotherapy and 
                pain medication to just a warm compress twice a day. I use positive reinforcement (treats, praise, and cuddles) for his behavior 
                which I have found to be really effective when it comes to larger dogs. However, I have to give Charlie most of the credit for 
                how far he has come. He is extremely smart and learns really fast.</p>
